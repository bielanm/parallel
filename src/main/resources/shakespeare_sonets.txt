From fairest creatures we desire increase,$
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,$
But as the riper should by time decease,$
His tender heir might bear his memory:,$
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,$
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,$
Making a famine where abundance lies,$
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.$
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,$
And only herald to the gaudy spring,$
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,$
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:$
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,$
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.$

When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,$
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,$
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,$
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:$
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,$
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;$
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,$
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.$
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,$
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine$
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'$
Proving his beauty by succession thine.$
This were to be new made when thou art old,$
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.$

Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,$
Now is the time that face should form another,$
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,$
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.$
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb$
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?$
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,$
Of his self-love to stop posterity?$
Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee$
Calls back the lovely April of her prime,$
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,$
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.$
But if thou live remembered not to be,$
Die single and thine image dies with thee.$

NEXT

Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,$
Which I by lacking have supposed dead,$
And there reigns love and all love’s loving parts,$
And all those friends which I thought buried.$
How many a holy and obsequious tear$
Hath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye$
As interest of the dead, which now appear$
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!$
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,$
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,$
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;$
That due of many now is thine alone:$
 Their images I loved I view in thee,$
 And thou, all they, hast all the all of me$

 Когда твое чело избороздят$
 Глубокими следами сорок зим,$
 Кто будет помнить царственный наряд,$
 Гнушаясь жалким рубищем твоим?$

 И на вопрос: "Где прячутся сейчас$
 Остатки красоты веселых лет?" -$
 Что скажешь ты? На дне угасших глаз?$
 Но злой насмешкой будет твой ответ.$

 Достойней прозвучали бы слова:$
 "Вы посмотрите на моих детей.$
 Моя былая свежесть в них жива,$
 В них оправданье старости моей".$

 Пускай с годами стынущая кровь$
 В наследнике твоем пылает вновь!$
